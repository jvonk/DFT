[![Review Assignment Due Date](https://classroom.github.com/assets/deadline-readme-button-22041afd0340ce965d47ae6ef1cefeee28c7c493a6346c4f15d667ab976d596c.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/a/jIwgLRNA)

I made two changes since the submission deadline:
1. I fixed the code in ``src/header_file.hpp``, specifically, the ``DFT::density`` function to fix the mistake in the assignment. Then I reran the calculations and copied the outputs to the ``student_output/hw6_1`` directory.
2. I changed the graphs of the wavefunction in ``Chem179-HW06.ipynb`` to include all of the slices along the specified direction instead of only the one closest to the center.
If you want, you can ignore this change by only looking at the wavefunction with the highest magnitude, which is the one I was including before.
